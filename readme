NOTE:
	
YOU MUST ONLY USE BASIC ARRAYS TO MODEL THE BOARD STATE – if this is not done, the maximum mark that can be attained is 5/10.

The non-AI part (2 human players) is worth 7 marks
The recursive minimax version (1 human vs AI) is worth 3 marks

This assignment loses 30% each day (based on the date) after the 4thApril. 
This means if it is submitted 12:01 AM (1 minute late) on the 5th, the maximum mark that can be got is 7/10.
This means if it is submitted 12:01 AM on the 6th, the maximum mark that can be got is 4/10.
It is therefore better to submit a non-working AI version on time than an AI version late.
